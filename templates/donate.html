    <p>The Leadership Training Institute is fully funded by outside grants,
        fellowships, and donations. Our funds go to developing mentor and
        student leadership skills, funding final projects and subsidizing
        travel expenses for students in need of financial support.  To support
        our studentsâ€™ desire to give back to the community, please donate
        <a href="https://giving.mit.edu/givenow/add-designation.dyn?designationId=2721288">here</a>.</p>
